The previous AI engineer successfully developed a roguelike game from scratch, iteratively adding complex features based on user feedback. Initially, the core game loop, player movement, basic shooting, and a rudimentary enemy/XP system were established. Subsequent iterations focused on advanced mechanics: screen shake, a versatile particle system, and a progressive wave manager with varied enemy behaviors and bosses.

A significant portion of the work involved resolving deployment issues for GitHub Pages, transitioning from a landing page + game subfolder approach to a direct game-as-root deployment. The AI also refined game physics, introduced emoji-based visuals, enhanced enemy AI (pursuit, shooting patterns), and adjusted game balance (shot speed, spawn rates, enemy speed scaling). Recent efforts involved scaling game elements to Full HD resolution and addressing power-up functionality and additive progression, alongside boss behavior adjustments, though the full implementation of these last points needs verification. The  file is the central hub for all game logic and rendering.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a roguelike game where a wizard shoots spells upwards, enemies descend while shooting back, and the game features XP, levels, and power-up selections. Difficulty increases with level, offering more XP. Obstacles descend to crush the player. The game should exponentially increase enemy count/strength as the wizard gains power/abilities, until the wizard loses health. Power-ups should include life, strength, and different magic effects, pausing the game upon level-up for selection.

Initial requirements specified WASD movement, brief spacebar jump/flight, automatic mouse-aimed shooting, gravity-limited movement, and random enemy generation with scaling strength. Detailed power-up lists (Common to Legendary, Offensive, Defensive, Utility/Scale) were provided, with 3-4 options per level. Visuals were to be pixelated with a black background and neon enemies.

Subsequent enhancements included: screen shake based on damage, advanced particle system (fire/smoke/explosion/magic behaviors, shapes), varied enemy types (basic, zigzag, tank, shooter, teleporter, boss with unique behaviors), progressive wave system (intermissions, bosses every 5 waves, scalable difficulty), synergistic power-ups, visual feedback (damage numbers, hit indicators), sound system, different magic types (charge shot, trails), combo system, dash/dodge, object pooling, currency/shop for permanent/temporary upgrades, achievements, local leaderboard, parallax backgrounds, enemy bullets array, multi-phase bosses, improved UI, save/load, and fine difficulty balancing. Specific focus was given to additive power-up progression (e.g., +1 shot instead of replacing) and a dynamic boss introduction. The screen size was later requested to be Full HD (1920x1080).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React Frontend**: The application uses React for its user interface.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: The core game rendering and logic are built using the Canvas API.
- **Game Loop**: A continuous loop manages game state updates and rendering.
- **Collision Detection**: Essential for interactions between player, enemies, bullets, and obstacles.
- **State Management (React Hooks)**:  is heavily used to manage the mutable  for game objects and properties.
- **Particle Systems**: Custom  class for visual effects (explosions, magic, fire).
- **Wave Management**: Custom  class handles enemy spawning, wave progression, and boss encounters.
- **GitHub Pages CI/CD**: Automated deployment workflow using GitHub Actions for hosting the React app.
- **CSS Styling (Tailwind CSS)**: Used for responsive UI adjustments and visual presentation.

<code_architecture>
The application primarily resides within the  directory, following a standard React project structure.



-   ****: This is the most critical file, serving as the monolithic core of the game. It encapsulates:
    -   The main React component for rendering the game canvas.
    -   All game logic, including  (for player, enemies, bullets, obstacles, particles, screen shake, wave manager),  loop,  loop.
    -   Implementation of player controls (WASD, Space, Mouse).
    -   Collision detection logic.
    -   Power-up application and state management.
    -   The  class,  class, and  for different enemy types.
    -   UI rendering for HUD (health, XP, score, wave status).
    -   **Changes Made**: This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the trajectory, incorporating all game mechanics, physics adjustments (gravity, jump, flight limits), enemy AI (pursuit, shooting, special behaviors), screen shake, advanced particles, wave management, emoji visuals, game balancing (shot speed, spawn rates, enemy speed), and screen resolution changes. It also includes the logic for power-ups and obstacles.

-   ****: Contains CSS rules primarily for styling the game canvas container, HUD elements, and responsive adjustments for different screen sizes.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to handle larger screen resolutions (Full HD) and improved responsiveness for various viewports.

-   ****: Defines project metadata and dependencies. Crucial for yarn install v1.22.22

    -   **Changes Made**: Initially missing, it was created. Later, the  field was adjusted to support GitHub Pages deployment to a subpath () and then to the root ().

-   ****: This file is now the primary entry point for the deployed React game on GitHub Pages.
    -   **Changes Made**: It was initially a separate landing page, but was later replaced by the React application's  content to make the game the direct root page.

-   ****: This file contains the content of the original landing page, moved from .
    -   **Changes Made**: Created when the  from the React build was moved to the root.

-   ****: Defines the GitHub Actions workflow for building the React application and deploying it to GitHub Pages.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to adjust deployment paths, first to  subfolder, then directly to the repository root.

-   ****: Project documentation, installation, and deployment instructions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to provide comprehensive details for the game, including setup and GitHub Pages deployment.

<pending_tasks>
- Ensure power-up effects are additive/stackable (e.g., +1 shot instead of replacing existing shot count).
- Verify that chain shot and explosive shot power-ups are functioning as expected.
- Implement a boss introduction sequence (mid-screen, gaining size, increasing difficulty over time based on player delay in killing).
- Adjust boss projectile behavior to be random and numerous but slower, allowing for player evasion.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was addressing several critical improvements related to game balance and progression:

The user's last request in Chat Message 188 specifically asked for:
1.  **Additive Power-ups**: Instead of replacing, power-ups like  shot should stack (e.g., double shot -> triple shot). This applies to all upgrades (life, resistance, etc.) which should evolve progressively.
2.  **Verify Chain/Explosive Shot**: Re-confirm that these specific projectile effects are functioning.
3.  **Boss Projectile Balancing**: Bosses are shooting too fast; projectiles should be numerous but slower to allow player dodging, rather than relying on rapid speed.
4.  **Boss Introduction**: Implement a visual introduction for bosses, possibly appearing mid-screen, growing in size, and dynamically increasing difficulty as the player delays defeating them.

The last action taken by the AI engineer was acknowledging this request (Chat Message 189) and then an observation (Chat Message 190) indicating that the  content in  was already updated with the new version. This suggests an attempt was made to implement the additive power-up logic. However, given the nature of the previous conversation where power-ups were a recurring issue, this update needs verification. The boss behavior and introduction elements were not explicitly confirmed as implemented in the last few messages.

<optional_next_step>
Verify and ensure all power-up effects, especially chain and explosive shots, are working correctly with additive scaling as requested.
